## Notes 

* One thing that became a challenge was getting the binding right [My app would crash because some values would not be returned in the api request]
* Getting the share button and link click listener binded on the adaper became a challenge 
* Problem with binding the activity layout with the activity class. [Had to do it differently than done in fragments]
* Parameters for the api request along with the GET call [Didn't know how to format it for OMDb Api and some parameters like calling by title would not work]
